Learning to use d3 for data visualization

Have successfully implimented this project for my Prime Solo Project, but there is still much to learn about D3.

For instance: I am primarily concerned with implimenting D3 with Angular for responsive, interactive data manipulation. However, formatting my data to play well with on the fly SVG drawing was quite tricky. The use of scales will obviously be very important, as it allows us to establish responsive ranges.

For my next attempt, I will be exploring zoomable, branching bubble graphs. Each bubble must contain information, as well as display a relationship to other bubbles.
